A Turing project. I followed the design comp, with the given liberty of choosing background and design logos. The intent of this project was to recreate the design aspects as closely as possible, while incorprating flex breakpoints and arranging layout according to our best judgement.  I used three breakpoints (resulting in 4 layouts) to keep content appearance neat and free from undesireable percentage-based sizing effects. The design is responsive in both the x and y axis.
